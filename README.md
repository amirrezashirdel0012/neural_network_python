# Neural Network Learning Repository
# Welcome to my Neural Network learning journey!

This repository is a collection of code, experiments, and notes as I explore the fascinating world of neural networks using Python.

# Project Structure:

## notebooks:
Jupyter notebooks containing code, explanations, and visualizations.
## scripts:
tandalone Python scripts for specific tasks or experiments.
## data:
Datasets used for training and testing models.
## models:
Saved trained models.
## images:
Visualizations and diagrams.

# Topics Covered:

## Fundamentals:
- Introduction to neural networks
- Linear algebra and calculus basics
- Activation functions
- Loss functions
- Optimization algorithms (gradient descent, Adam, etc.)
## Neural Network Architectures:
- Perceptron
- Multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Â  
- Autoencoders
## Deep Learning Frameworks:

# Getting Started:

1- Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/amirrezashirdel0012/neural-network-python.git`

2- Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3- Explore the notebooks: 
Open the Jupyter notebooks or any IDE to follow along with the learning process.
I strongly recommend that to use VSCODE

# Contributing:
While this repository is primarily for my learning, feel free to fork it and experiment. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Disclaimer:
The code and explanations in this repository are for educational purposes only. I am still learning and the code may not be optimized or production-ready.
